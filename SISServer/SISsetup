Steps to test your Plug-in Component

Step 1: Change directory to local directory containing java source programs.


Step 2: Compile the SIS Server.

javac SISServer.java

Step 3: Run SIS Server

java SISServer

Step 4: Run the Remote Interface.

Click on prjRemote to run it, set IP 127.0.0.1, port 7999, click 'connect'

Step 5: Load start-up xml

If you are testing component, say InputProcessor, you need to use prjRemote to load the corresponding CreateInputProcessor.xml, then click 'send'
Multiple xmls need to be loaded if you are testing more than one type of components.

Step 6: Compile your written Plug-in component.

javac <YourPluginComponent>.java

Step 7: Run the Plug-in component where the IP address 127.0.0.1 is the local IP address of the SIS Server.

java YourPluginComponent 127.0.0.1

Step 8: Test your component

Now you are ready to experiment with your Plug-in Component. You can load test msgs from the left pane of prjRemote then send, all the msgs received by the server from your component will be displayed in the right panel.

Step 9: Finish the test

When turning off the server, first close the components, then prjRemote, finally the server
